React Kronos
============

A fast, intuitive, and elegant date and time picker for React.

## Philosophy

- Works straight out of the box with no props
- Provide a couple props and options that give lots of control
- Allow for granular control when needed
- Style is done in JS and can be easily modified
- Beautiful code and appearance

## [Demo](http://dubert.github.io/react-kronos)
- make beautiful website
- link to github
- link to npm

#### Rationale

Even though there are many React Date and/or Time components, I'm developing my own because none of them do everything that I need.

Key requirements:
- Separate date and/or time components (many only have date)
- Easily style-able from JS (not have to muck around in the css)
- Return multiple time formats (Date, Moment, ISO, string)
- Lightweight, use no jquery
- Active on focus, disappear on blur
- Efficient keyboard navigation

#### See Also

Kronos is built from scratch, but heavily inspired by:

*UX & UI:*
- Google Calendar's input fields

*Code & UX:*
- [react-widgets datetimepicker](http://jquense.github.io/react-widgets/docs/#/datetime-picker)
- [react-input-calendar](https://github.com/Rudeg/react-input-calendar)

## Construction progress

#### TODO

- **Demo website**
- **NPM Install**
- **Features**
- **Usage / Documentation**

#### Roadmap

0.1:
- ~~date & time inputs~~
- ~~formatting (input & returning)~~
- common style variables (highlight color, font family, rounded corners)
- options: customize with moment locale

0.2:
- granular styling (overwrite any style, or provide entire theme)
- options:
  - date (restrict calendar to show only days, or with months, or with years)
  - time (set increments, set ranges of time)

0.3:
- minimum date+time
  - hard (user cannot select a date/time, or type/paste a value)
  - soft (user can select/input values but it becomes red)
- maximum date+time
  - hard
  - soft
- support for connected start & end date+time
  - date (show range on calendar)
  - time (show "0 hours", "0.5 hours", "1 hour", &c)

#### Props

Current:
- `date`
- `time`
- `format` - [Moment formatting](http://momentjs.com/docs/#/parsing/string-format/) of date / time
- `onChange` - change method called when there is a new value
- `returnAs` - onChange format `jsdate`, `moment`, `iso`, `string`
- `close` - closes the dropdown when a value is selected
- `placeholder` - placeholder text when there is no value

Coming:
- `min` - minimum allowable value
- `max` - maximum allowable value
- options
  - date
  - time
  - moment locale (for customization)
- style (CSS)
  - common variables
  - granular style

#### Ideas

- input field masking
- scroll time list as user arrows up+down
- â‡§+arrow uses the higher order unit
- make it immutable
- maintain a CHANGELOG
